    <p>Prof. Celia E. Naylor conceived of this project at the Barnard Digital Humanities Center in the summer of 2018 as part of the [[name of grant]]. In 2019, Madiha Choksi, Alex Gil, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira and Kristen Akey began working on a prototype of the project with Prof. Naylor. In 2020, immediately after the lockdown in New York, Alex and Moacir chose the project to be the subject of the trial run of the Studio Remote. They build most of the project live on Fridays. The record of their work can be found on YouTube.</p>
