      The Rose Hall Great House in Jamaica is one of the country’s most visited historical attractions. Despite the opportunity to provide visitors with information about the enslaved persons who were forced to live and work at that plantation and slavery in Jamaica, over many decades the Rose Hall Great House tours have centered the fictional myth of a White Witch. This website, however, aims to re-center the lives of enslaved persons at Rose Hall Plantation. This website serves as a companion piece to <a href="https://barnard.edu/profiles/celia-e-naylor">Celia E. Naylor</a>’s book entitled <a href="https://ugapress.org/book/9780820362151/unsilencing-slavery/"><i>(Un)Silencing Slavery: Telling Truths about Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica</i></a>. University of Georgia Press, Gender and Slavery Series, July 2022.

      Based on the archival work and research of Jamaican-born and U.S.-based scholar Celia E. Naylor at the Jamaica Archives in Spanish Town, Jamaica, and the National Archives in Kew, England, this website names and highlights the 208 enslaved persons at Rose Hall Plantation included in archival documents crafted in the time period between 1817 and 1832. We include specific information about their individual experiences and their familial connections. We also ask you to imagine the community/communities they created at Rose Hall, as well as the interactions, relationships, and communities they likely engendered with free and enslaved persons at other plantations near and far.

      Without any extant photographs of the 208 persons named here, this website features a visual and virtual representation of the community/communities of enslaved persons at Rose Hall Plantation from 1817 to 1832. We sought to push the limits of visualization as a medium to learn where it could fail or succeed in representing the reductive and dehumanizing data we inherit from the archival records. Our data in particular was collected and compiled from archival documents from 1817 to 1832. The process of transferring the data into our main visualization, the flower of Rose Hall, involved many micro-decisions and careful consideration. The results are ambiguous: wholly escaping the violence of the datafication of lives is impossible. In the end, all we could achieve was the dignity of centering the enslaved persons and the softening of the sharp edges of traditional forms of visualization.

      We have included copies of selected archival documents to provide some sense of the extant historical materials available for future research for anyone interested in learning and writing more about them.  The National Archives of the United Kingdom permitted us to include the triennial slave registers of Rose Hall from 1817 to 1832 (housed in Kew, England). We are still working on permission from the Jamaica Archives to include selections from the Rose Hall Journal (housed only at the Jamaica Archives). However, the Jamaica Archives allowed us to include a few pages of the Rose Hall Journal in the book itself. A selected bibliography for additional reading has been provided for your perusal. For those whose ancestors are included here, we hope this information will offer some assistance in your quest to learn more about your ancestors.

    <h2>Family at Rose Hall</h2>
    <p>
      Due to the limitations of the archival material, and the tenets of the slavocracy in Jamaica and in other parts of the African diaspora, the historical records mentioned only those named as the biological mothers of enslaved children (with no information noted regarding the biological fathers of enslaved children) at Rose Hall. Thus, the racial, gendered, and classed aspects of the Jamaican slavocracy systematically truncated personal and familial connections in the archival record by excluding references to men who might have considered themselves, and were considered by others to be, part of familial frameworks and networks. Even though we were unable to include definitive references to biological fathers and/or to men who played nurturing roles in these Rose Hall families and the broader enslaved community (as “other fathers”), we have utilized archival documents to present familial histories embedded within a communal context. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The multigenerational presence of several enslaved families and the myriad multigenerational communal connections at Rose Hall reflect the branches and roots of a community tree. It is important to note that the archival record does not provide a comprehensive narrative of relationships between enslaved people and kinship connections (whether consanguineal—by blood—and/or “fictive” and expansive). The term “fictive” kin/kinship has long been utilized in scholarly work. Instead of describing these connections as “fictive” kinship relationships, here we suggest utilizing the term “expansive kinship relationships.” These relationships between people who were not related by blood or marriage did not make them contrived or fictitious in any way.

      The subject of enslaved family structures in Jamaica has been, and continues to be, an ongoing contested topic. Some have posited that enslaved Jamaican families lived primarily in nuclear families, and others have underscored more matrifocal and matrilineal family structures. Even as the trajectory in slavery studies may still be moving generally along a fairly traditional, heteronormative pathway undertaking to reconstruct and highlight heteronormative relationships, partnerships, and marriages, there have been <a href="https://qswg.tumblr.com/">new initiatives related to “queering slavery”</a> and moving beyond socially constructed and restrictive heteronormative parameters. The matrilineages on this website (and in the book) are not offered as deficient family trees. Instead, they reflect core, foundational elements of numerous familial and other intimate relationships that may or may not have included a significant nurturing male presence. The absence of a male presence and male lineage in the recording of births at Rose Hall and other Caribbean plantations in archival documents does not necessarily or automatically translate into a crucial role that has been denied. We cannot assume that all enslaved children who were fathered by enslaved men emerged out of loving, monogamous, heteronormative partnerships at Rose Hall. It is most likely that those enslaved children who were fathered by enslaved men were born due to multiple, complicated, intimate relationships that might have been short-lived or long-lasting, monogamous or polyamorous, consensual or nonconsensual, and even beyond any of the monikers we use in the present day to categorize and simplify the complex interactions and intimacies between persons. To consider a community framework (and community tree—in addition to biologically-centered family lineages) including women, men, and children at Rose Hall offers an opportunity for us to move beyond linear lineages to community lineages and more so communal groundings. Some of these intimacies and interactions would also have been fashioned due to gendered identities and generational cohorts.

      We have constructed, and hold, this space as a memorial, as a site of mourning and grieving, as a gesture of gratitude and appreciation, and as a catalyst for the ongoing recognition, exploration, and presentation of the enslaved persons of African descent at Rose Hall. This space is a dedicated space of remembrance for all those named and unnamed who heretofore have not been publicly acknowledged or memorialized. It was also conceived in recognition of, and resistance to, what continues to be silenced about them and the institution of slavery today. We hope this site will encourage others to carve out spaces, virtual and otherwise, for the necessary and continuous remembrance of enslaved Africans and their descendants throughout the African diaspora.
