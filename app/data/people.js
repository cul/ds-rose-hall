In the 1832 list Adonis was described as the \u201cHead Cooper.\u201d As a cooper, Adonis would have been an artisan\/craftsperson skilled at making wooden barrels (often called hogsheads and tierces at the time) to contain and ship the items enslaved people produced at Rose Hall (including sugar, rum, and molasses). As Head Cooper, he would have been responsible for the overall creation, repair, and supervision of these containers.###The Rose Hall Journal noted that Adonis ran away on May 29, 1830 \u201con being ordered to work in the field\u201d (vol. 3, folio 74). Adonis\u2019 position as Head Cooper had removed him from laboring as a field worker. It is not clear what had transpired for Adonis to be \u201cordered to work in the field.\u201d His health challenges with yaws may well have impacted his use of rum to assuage the painful symptoms of this disease. His description as a \u201cdrunkard\u201d may have resulted in the punishment of being ordered to the fields. Whatever the reason for the order, Adonis decided to run away instead of working in the fields. It is unclear when Adonis returned or was brought back to Rose Hall. However, in 1832, 2 years after his runaway attempt, he was listed as Head Cooper.###The extant records do not include information about all of Adonis\u2019 familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or the African diaspora.

    "profile":"Archey was Creole. Archey was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall, and he was listed as Creole, negro (in colour), 11 years old, and son of Zebra (Creole).###Multiple notations in the Rose Hall Journal mentioned that Archey ran away from Rose Hall on at least 15 separate occasions between 1821 and 1826. His first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 15, was noted on November 19, 1821 (vol. 1, folio 231). After at least 11 runaway attempts, a note in the journal stated that on August 20, 1823 \u201cArchy sent to Falmouth Workhouse for punishment\u201d (vol. 2, folio 11). Unlike workhouses in England that functioned as almshouses, workhouses in colonial Jamaica were jails. On October 6, 1823, Archey was released and returned to Rose Hall after approximately 6 weeks at the Falmouth Workhouse. A little over a month after being released from the workhouse, Archey attempted to run away a few more times between 1824 and 1826. The final notation about Archey at Rose Hall appeared in the 1826 Slave Register; at age 20, Archey was \u201ctransported\u201d off the island as his final punishment at Rose Hall. It is likely that Archey had been born and labored at Rose Hall until he was transported off the island; the details of Archey\u2019s life before 1817 or after 1826 have not been uncovered at this time.###Archey\u2019s mother Zebra (Creole) was a field worker at Rose Hall. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall (4 of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Rose, Dianna\/Diana, James, and Charles). Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child. Zebra\u2019s son Robert passed at the age of 7. Archey\u2019s brother James also ran away from Rose Hall multiple times, and due to these runaway attempts, James was described as a \u201cnotorious runaway\u201d in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List.###The extant records do not include information about all of Archey\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Archey\u2019s biological father or whether Archey was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora.",

Arteris\u2019 name was included only in a brief notation in the Rose Hall Journal for the week of May 2, 1819.

In the journal entry no information was included about whether Arteris was African-born or Creole; no information about Arteris\u2019 gender was noted.

Charlie\u2019s duties at Rose Hall were not included in the archival documents; the documents did not include the reason(s) for his passing.###Notations in the Rose Hall Journal indicated that between 1817 and 1825 Charley ran away at least 6 times on his own and with other enslaved persons. Charley\u2019s first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 40, was noted in the journal on April 21, 1817 (vol. 1, folio 2). The journal entry stated that \u201cCharley and Doshy still away.\u201d Doshy\/Doshey was an enslaved Creole woman who ran away from Rose Hall at least 16 times between 1817 and 1822\u2014the most recorded runaway attempts by any enslaved woman at Rose Hall. Doshy\u2019s runaway attempts would probably have continued had it not been for her passing on November 8, 1823; the 1826 Slave Register noted that she was 28 years old at the time of her passing. Charley also ran away multiple times with Arabella. Arabella was an African-born enslaved woman who, like Doshy, absconded from Rose Hall numerous times; Arabella ran away at least 13 times between 1817 and 1832. Indeed, in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Arabella was noted as a runaway and absent from Rose Hall at the time the list was being prepared. Charley also ran away multiple times with Mercury (Creole). Mercury\u2019s multiple runaway attempts resulted in his imprisonment in the Montego Bay jail in January 1821. Two weeks after he was imprisoned, a Rose Hall Journal entry mentioned that Mercury passed in the Montego Bay jail (vol. 1, folios 187 and 189). Charley also ran away with January on separate occasions. In the journal entries, Charley was described as having absconded from Rose Hall solo, as well as at the same time as Mercury or Arabella or with all 3 being listed as \u201cstill away\u201d (vol. 1, folios 3, 4, 40, 50, 51, 55, 141, 143, 146, 147, and 149).###A journal entry noted Charley\u2019s final departure from Rose Hall on August 1, 1825 (vol. 2, folio 112). Only 3 months later, another journal entry noted that \u201can old Negro Man named Charley found dead in the Woods, absconded from here on the 1st of August 1825\u2014an Inquest was held. Verdict died by the Visitation of God\u201d (vol. 2, folio 126). Although the inquest must have been arranged due to questions surrounding Charley\u2019s passing in the woods. It is unclear what particular issues were raised at the time. It is possible that self-imposed injuries or injuries caused by another person might have resulted in Charley\u2019s passing. In the end, his passing was deemed a divine act at the \u201cold\u201d age of 47. It is possible that Charley had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Charley\u2019s life before 1817 have not been uncovered at this time.###The extant records do not include information about all of Charley\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Charley\u2019s parents. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we also do not know whether Charley was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora. Some at Rose Hall and even at other plantations in the Americas may well have been his biological grandchildren.",

Given that Christianna\u2019s job was at the overseer\u2019s house and that both Henry and her other child, Jane, were categorized as mulatto, it is possible that her circumstances related to the overseer might also have contributed to her desire to run far away from Rose Hall. Christianna\u2019s mother (and Henry\u2019s grandmother) was Miranda (African-born). Henry\u2019s aunt and uncle (Christianna\u2019s siblings) were Memmy Jen, Glister, and Patrick, and his cousins (Christianna\u2019s nephews and niece) were Sam, Isaac, and Marinda. It is also possible that Christianna had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Henry\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",

The other person, named Henry, was Creole and most likely mulatto (in colour), although he was described inconsistently in the archival records as negro (in colour) and mulatto (in colour). Henry McLean's birth was recorded in the Rose Hall Journal on August 1, 1825. That week, the journal noted \u201cMary James delivered of a male child named Henry McLean\u201d (vol.2, folio 113b). In the 1826 Slave Register, Henry McLean was described as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 1 year old, and son of Mary James (Creole and mulatto). In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Henry McLean was listed as 6 years old, not at work (due to his age), \u201cable,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition. The details of Henry McLean\u2019s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Henry McLean\u2019s biological father. However, as Henry McLean was described as mulatto, he had a white biological father. At Rose Hall Plantation possible white fathers would have included the overseers and bookkeepers, as well as enslaver John Rose Palmer himself. Mary James was categorized as mulatto, which indicated that her father was a white man. We do not know who Mary James\u2019s father was or what conditions led to her mother Rosannah (Creole) giving birth to Mary James. We also do not know which white man (or white men) sired Mary James\u2019 children; she had at least 5 children at Rose Hall\u20142 daughters Peggy (quadroon) and Eliza Hill (mulatto), and 3 sons John Kerr (quadroon), Henry McLean (mulatto) and Edward Hill (mulatto). It is possible the Henry McLean might have been miscategorized as mulatto (instead of being described as quadroon) or his biological father might also have been mulatto.###Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Peggy passed at 2 years old. We do not know how the passing of Peggy specifically affected Mary James. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James\u2019s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Henry McLean\u2019s maternal grandmother, and Celia (Creole) was his maternal great grandmother. The extant records do not include information about all of Henry McLean\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. ###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.",

He was approximately 13 years old when his first runaway attempt was recorded on July 31, 1821. The overseer officially noted some form of punishment for his runaway attempts though it did not curtail Hercules\u2019 desires to run away.

Later on October 24, 1830, the overseer relayed that \u201cHercules made his Escape from Confinement\u201d (vol. 3, folio 84), which is the only reference concerning him being punished via confinement at Rose Hall. Within a month of Hercules escaping confinement, on November 16, 1830, the overseer noted, \u201cHercules after being pardoned for his last offense again made his exit without cause.\u201d (vol. 3, folio 86) In only 2 of Hercules\u2019 runaway attempts did overseers note that Hercules had \u201creturned\u201d and not been \u201cbrought home.\u201d###Hercules is 1 of only 3 boys (between 1 and 17 years old) in the 1817 Slave Register not described as having a biological mother at Rose Hall.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, James was described as 18 years old, and \u201cable and healthy.\u201d His primary position was listed as \u201cCattleboy,\u201dand he probably worked alongside Oliver, William Kerr, Othello, Adam and Isaac\u2014who were also Creole and listed as cattleboys.###James was also described as a \u201cnotorious runaway.\u201d James ran away from Rose Hall at least 5 times between 1817 and 1832.

James also ran away at least on a couple of occasions at the same time as (or possibly with) Hercules, as the entry in the Rose Hall Journal on June 14, 1830 noted \u201cHercules & James once more absconded without cause\u201d (vol. 3, folio 76).###The details of James\u2019 life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time, but on March 20, 1832, it was recorded that James ran away (vol. 3, folio 119), and he was still away when the 1832 Clothing Allowance List was created.

He and John Parish were the two eldest Creole enslaved persons listed in the 1817 slave register.###Rose Hall Journal entries noted Johnny having absconded twice in 1818. His first attempt was noted in the Rose Hall Journal on July 27, 1818 (vol. 1, folio 64). The journal also mentioned his return a few days later on July 31, 1818 (vol. 1, folio 64). On his second attempt, on September 1, 1818, a note in the Rose Hall Journal recorded that Johnny and Rose (Creole), who was 11 years old at the time and daughter of Zebra, ran away (vol. 1, folio 71). It is unclear if they ran away individually or together and what their particular connection(s) might have been at that time. However, Johnny was mentioned as still away on October 26, 1818, and it is not stated when exactly he returned or was brought back (vol. 1, folio 76).###A Rose Hall Journal entry on May 5, 1819 noted that Johny \u201cdied of Dyssentry\u201d (vol. 1, folio 102). Dysentery is an infection of the intestines, which causes the inflammation of the intestines and severe diarrhea. His passing at 50 years old was also recorded in the 1820 Register. It is possible that Johnny had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817; the details of Johnny\u2019s life before 1817 have not been uncovered at this time.###The extant records do not include information about Johnny\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. We do not know the names of Johnny\u2019s parents; both were most likely African-born. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know whether Johnny was a biological father of children at Rose Hall or had additional children in Jamaica or in other parts of the African diaspora. Some at Rose Hall and even at other plantations in the Americas may well have been his biological grandchildren.",

Mark and other cartmen were responsible for moving goods between different areas at Rose Hall, between Rose Hall and other plantations, as well as transporting the byproducts of the plantation (sugar and rum) to the wharf to be transported to England.###Multiple notations in the Rose Hall Journal mentioned that Mark ran away from Rose Hall, both alone and with others, on at least 12 separate occasions between 1817 and 1831.

We have no archival records indicating whether his biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Ned was born). His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. As his primary position was at the \u201cOverseer's House,\u201d it is possible that this position reflected a connection to the overseer. Ned was 1 of 3 children described as at the overseer\u2019s house. The other 2 children were John Kerr and Richard Mabon, who were both Creole and classified as quadroon.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###Ned had one recorded runaway attempt. On June 9, 1830, it was noted that \u201cNed went out to catch the overseers mule & absconded before feeding it.\u201d The mule in question was reported to have died (vol. 3, folio 75). Later in the month, on June 21, 1830, Ned was brought back to Rose Hall (vol. 3, folio 76). The details of Ned\u2019s life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Mary had at least 4 other children (Ned\u2019s siblings)\u2014Jemmy, Sally Rose, John, and Allick. However, by 1832, 3 of her children\u2014Ned, Sally Rose, and Jemmy\u2014were alive. Mary\u2019s mother (Ned\u2019s grandmother), Maphe (Creole) only had one child\u2014Mary. However, it is still possible that Mary and Maphe had other children and grandchildren who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Ned\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",

Rachel\u2019s only child noted at Rose Hall was Peter. Given that she was 62 years old in 1817, Peter may not have been her first child. In the 1832 Clothing Allowance List Peter was listed as 32 years old, \u201cable and healthy,\u201d and \u201cindolent.\u201d###He was the only enslaved person listed as a \u201cFisherman\u201d in 1832, but he was not the only enslaved person to utilize the conditions of his position as an opportunity to run away. The Rose Hall Journal included notations of two of Peter\u2019s runaway attempts. Peter\u2019s first attempt, mentioned in the Rose Hall Journal on December 13, 1828, involved Hercules; the entry stated: \u201cHercules absconded on the 13th Inst. from Peter in consequence of which Peter has likewise absented himself\u201d (vol. 2, folio 29). In this instance, Peter seemed to be entangled in one of Hercules' numerous runaway attempts, and Hercules\u2019 action in this case appeared to inform Peter\u2019s own decision to abscond\u2014perhaps it seemed an opportune time to run away or possibly to avert being punished due to Hercules\u2019 actions. It is unclear why Peter seemed to be responsible for Hercules at this time. However, on December 15, 1828, the very day that Peter was brought back to Rose Hall was the exact day that someone was sent to the Montego Bay Workhouse (vol. 3, folio 30). That person remained there through the holidays, and he was not released until January 3, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 35). This person was probably Peter. His second attempt was recorded on November 30 1829: \u201cPeter the fisherman being sent from the field to fish. Thot proper to absent himself for 3 days & was afterwards caught\u201d (vol. 3, folio 60). Once again, it seemed that Peter utilized another situation involving his fisherman duties to abscond from Rose Hall. This particular description provides a sense of Peter\u2019s combined duties of fisherman and field worker.###It is possible that Peter had labored at Rose Hall for many years and decades; the details of Peter\u2019s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. The extant records do not include information about all of Peter\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.

The cart was also described as the \u201cmule cart\u201d in the Rose Hall Journal.

On one occasion in August 1826, Pitt was supposed to be tending cattle with his brother, Ben (Creole), and Anthony (Creole). Instead, he absconded from Rose Hall with them; as a result, the cattle left the pen and destroyed a significant portion of sugarcane plants (vol. 2, folio 164). Pitt also appeared to run away with other enslaved persons, including Bolton, Archey, Hercules, Anthony, and Kitty.

Glister was also the daughter of Miranda (Sam\u2019s African maternal grandmother) and possibly granddaughter of Memmy Sen (African-born).###Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Sam\u2019s biological father.

Glister\u2019s daughter who died within the frequently referenced nine-day period is not included in the 1826 Slave Register.

Although the birth and passing of Glister\u2019s newborn daughter were noted in the Rose Hall Journal, they were not included in the 1826 Slave Register. Glister\u2019s daughter was not the only newborn who died within the nine-day period and whose birth and passing were not recorded in the slave register. Indeed, the journal also mentioned the deaths of other unnamed newborns. We do not know how the passing of Sam and his sister specifically affected their mother Glister.

The details of Thomas\u2019 life after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time. ###Susannah Johnston had at least 5 other children (Thomas\u2019 siblings)\u2014Helen, Phillis, Eve, Ellen (also referred to as Julian), and July. Susannah Johnston (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of multiple children\u2014Helen in 1820, Ellen\/Julian in 1826, and a daughter who passed at 3 days old. It is also possible that Susannah Johnston had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. The extant records do not include information about all of Thomas\u2019 familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Thomas\u2019 biological father.",

However, as William was described as mulatto, his biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether his white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before William was born). His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances.

Given the number of her runaway attempts, she should have been listed as a \u201cnotorious runaway\u201d\u2014a term used at the time for enslaved people who frequently ran away from plantations. Arabella ran away on her own; she also ran away at the same time with other enslaved persons, including Charley, Oserus, Mercury, Mark, and Scott. Some of these may have been coordinated, collective runaway attempts.###It is likely that when Arabella absconded from Rose Hall on June 3, 1832 (vol. 3, folio 125), this final runaway attempt was successful and resulted in her self-emancipation. When she absconded in early June 1832, this was more than a year before the British Slavery Abolition Act was passed in 1833, which took effect on August 1, 1834. The only other enslaved woman at Rose Hall who ran away more times than Arabella was Doshey; she ran away at least 16 times from Rose Hall Plantation within the 6-year period beginning in 1817 and ending when she passed in 1823.###In the 1832 list, Arabella\u2019s primary duties and position were described as \u201cField,\u201d which meant she would have been one of many field workers, skilled agriculturalists and often herbalists, who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 27 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition.###In the 1832 list, Bessy\u2019s primary duties and position were described as \u201cWasherwoman.\u201d As a washerwoman, she was one of the small number of enslaved women who was not primarily laboring in the sugarcane fields. Instead, her arduous work involved washing the clothes of the white enslavers of the Palmer family and any of their guests at Rose Hall. Her duties might also have been expanded on any given day due to the particular needs of the Palmer family and their guests. It is possible that Bessy had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Bessy\u2019s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Bessy was the daughter of Sarah (a Creole woman often referred to as Sambo Sarah). As Bessy was described as mulatto, her biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Bessy was born). Bessy\u2019s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by John Palmer. Between 1803 to 1808, Robert McLaren was one of the overseers who worked at Rose Hall and possibly for a short time at Palmyra in 1820-1821. Given his timing as overseer at Rose Hall, Bessy being born approximately in 1804, and Bessy\u2019s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Bessy\u2019s father.###Bessy had 2 sons\u2014Richard aka Richard Mabon (9 years old in 1832) and Robert (3 years old in 1832). Both Richard and Robert were described in the slave registers as \u201cquadroons.\u201d Bessy\u2019s son Robert\u2019s \u201cChristian name\u201d was listed as \u201cLawrence Low.\u201d Lawrence Lowe was one of the overseers at Rose Hall Plantation between 1826 and 1832. Bessy\u2019s son Richard was listed as \u201cat the Overseer\u2019s House\u201d in 1832, and Lawrence Lowe was overseer at that time. Moreover, as Robert was identified as a quadroon and with his particular \u201cChristian name,\u201d it is certainly feasible that his biological father was overseer Lawrence Lowe. Richard\u2019s position at the overseer\u2019s house did not necessarily indicate the breadth of the interactions between Bessy and the overseer Lawrence Lowe.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###We do not know whether both of Bessy\u2019s children had the same white biological father; we also do not know whether Bessy had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas. The extant records do not include information about all of Bessy\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.",

Given her age recorded in 1817, she was probably closer to 26 years old in 1832.###In the 1832 list, Brown\u2019s primary duties and position were described as \u201cField,\u201d which meant she would have been one of many field workers, skilled agriculturalists and often herbalists, who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers. It is possible that Brown had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Brown\u2019s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Brown had at least one child at Rose Hall\u2014a daughter named Charity.

It is possible that the younger Cecelia was named in honor of this elder African-born Cecelia.###This Cecelia was included in the first slave register of 1817 for Rose Hall; she was listed as African, negro (in colour), and 48 years old at that time. In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 62 years old, \u201cweakly,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition. It is possible that she had labored at Rose Hall for many years and even decades before 1817, but the details of her life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###In the 1832 list, Cecelia\u2019s duties were described as \u201cAttending Young Children.\u201d In 1832, unlike the other elder women in their 50s at Rose Hall, Cecelia was not assigned to grasscutting duties. Perhaps being in her 60s afforded her that limited benefit. She is the only person described as \u201cattending young children.\u201d The young children she attended were likely the 9 children (primarily under 4) who were described in the 1832 Clothing Allowance list as \u201cnot at work\u201d (i.e., Eliza Hill, Edward Hill, Henry McLean, James Watson, Jane, John, Ned, Robert, and Sylvia). Cecelia most likely had labored in the sugarcane fields of Rose Hall for many years, probably multiple decades, before transitioning to this particular duty of attending to the young children.###As mentioned in the book Unsilencing Slavery, given that she may have been responsible for attending to 9 young children (and possibly additional children in the hogmeat gang), this duty may have been onerous in other ways for a woman in her early 60s. We do not know whether she considered this duty a blessing, a burden, or both. As the eldest African-born woman at Rose Hall, Cecelia may have understood her job attending to young children as an avenue for sharing information about African history, stories, lessons, and cultural practices with these young children (and others at Rose Hall). Even as she attended to the young children, Cecelia also may have attended to the other enslaved mothers at Rose Hall, aiding and guiding them in the care of their young children in ways that integrated West African or West Central African cultural customs with which she was familiar.###We do not know the names of Cecelia\u2019s parents; both were most likely African-born. Cecelia had at least 3 children who resided at Rose Hall\u2014one daughter Liddy and 2 sons Smith and Harry. Cecelia was also the grandmother of at least 3 grandchildren\u2014Liddy\u2019s daughter Pastora and 2 sons North and Parish\/Paris. Cecelia outlived her daughter Liddy, who passed at the age of 30 and one of her grandsons, Parish\/Paris, who passed at the age of 4.###The extant records do not include information about all of Cecelia\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or her native home on the African continent. We also do not know whether Cecelia had additional children or grandchildren at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas, as well as children left behind in an African community (or communities).

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was noted as 21 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition.###In the 1832 list, Christianna\u2019s duties were described as \u201cOverseer\u2019s House.\u201d Christianna had at least two children at Rose Hall\u2014a son Henry and a daughter Jane. Christianna (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child, as Henry passed away at 2 years old in 1828\/1829. We do not know how the passing of her young son specifically affected Christianna. Her only runaway attempt was noted in the Rose Hall journal on July 16, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 50), which may have been partially as a result of Henry\u2019s passing.###Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name(s) of the biological father(s) of Christianna\u2019s children. However, as both of her children were categorized as mulatto, their biological father was a white man (or white men). Their father(s) may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. Given that Christianna\u2019s job was at the overseer\u2019s house and both of her children were categorized as mulatto, it is possible that her circumstances related to the white overseer might also have contributed to her desire to run far away from Rose Hall.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###The extant records do not include information about all of Christianna\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. We also do not know whether Christianna had additional children or grandchildren at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.

As discussed in the book Unsilencing Slavery: \u201cThe reasons for Dorinda\u2019s \u201cneglect\u201d of her duties are unknown. It is possible that Dorinda\u2019s own children demanded additional time and that her children\u2019s requests and her responses compromised her time and attention related to her midwifery duties.###The cumulative effects of the loss of 4 of Dorinda\u2019s children between 1818 and 1824 might also have informed her \u201cneglect\u201d of her duties related to other enslaved mothers and pregnant women. She might have been particularly neglectful with pregnant women with whom she did not get along and\/ or did not particularly like. No matter what the reasons for her \u201cneglect\u201d of her duties, the harsh reality of her punishment of being ordered to the field undeniably resulted in her decision to abscond quickly from Rose Hall. Yet her decision to return the following day may well have been guided by her familial and communal connections to Rose Hall.###Even if she had to serve temporarily as a field worker, she would still be physically close to her 5 children\u2014one of whom, her youngest, John, was not quite one at the time Dorinda ran away. Indeed, Dorinda\u2019s \u201cneglect\u201d may not have involved any \u201cneglect\u201d whatsoever, given the brutal, deleterious elements of slavery that reflected and exacerbated the precarity and disposability of Black life in the agri-industrial plantation complex in Jamaica.\u201d###We do not know the names of Dorinda\u2019s parents; both were most likely African-born. Dorinda had at least 9 children at Rose Hall\u20147 sons Sam, Anthony, William Kerr, Morris, Alick, Surry and John, and 2 daughters Eliza and Venus. Five of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Sam, Anthony, William, Venus, and John.

Being the midwife at Rose Hall and having experienced the passing of multiple children of her own might have exacerbated the range of feelings Dorinda experienced about the births and deaths of her children and the children of other women at Rose Hall.###The extant records do not include information about all of Dorinda\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora.

The other person named Eliza at Rose Hall was Creole, negro (in colour), and daughter of Dorinda. Eliza Hill was described in the 1829 Register as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 18 months old, and daughter of Mary James (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was listed as 4 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d of \u201cgood\u201d disposition, and \u201cnot at work\u201d (due to her age).###Eliza Hill\u2019s mother, Mary James, had at least 5 children at Rose Hall\u2014John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill and Peggy. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832 \u2014John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Peggy. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James\u2019s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Eliza Hill\u2019s maternal grandmother. Rosannah passed away before Eliza was born. Celia (Creole) was Eliza Hill\u2019s maternal great grandmother, and she had a long-recorded lineage at Rose Hall.###As both Mary James and Eliza Hill were described as mulatto, Eliza Hill\u2019s biological father was probably a white man (in which case Eliza Hill should have been categorized as a \u201cquadroon\u201d at that time). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Eliza Hill\u2019s biological father. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Eliza Hill was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family at that time.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###The extant records do not include information about all of Eliza Hill\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.

Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Glister\u2019s biological father.###In 1832, her duties were described as \u201cField\u201d which meant she would have been one of many field workers, skilled agriculturalists and often herbalists, who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###Glister gave birth to 3 children at Rose Hall\u2014a son named Sam, whose birth and passing at 10 days old were noted in the 1826 Slave Register and a daughter named Miranda (also referred to as Maranda\/Naranda). Miranda was noted as 18 months old in the 1829 Slave Register and (listed as Naranda) as 4 years old in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List.

The other enslaved person listed with this duty was Charles (Creole), who was 13 years old in 1832. The range of responsibilities involved in being with Mrs. Palmer is unclear. That Mrs. Palmer had 2 enslaved persons attending to her (1 male and the other female and both in their teens) may have reflected the breadth and range of duties that included domestic, personal care, as well as more involved arduous work that required the abilities of 2 enslaved people on a quotidian basis.###Jane Cranston had given birth to at least 1 child at Rose Hall\u2014a daughter Lydie. Jane (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child, as Lydie passed at 7 days old.

If Kitty\u2019s biological mother was not at Rose Hall, it is likely that another woman (or women), as well as other people in the Rose Hall community, continued to love and nurture Kitty.###Kitty ran away at least 4 times between 1828 and 1830. Although the first 3 recorded runaway attempts only mentioned Kitty, after her fourth runaway attempt on May 13, 1830 (vol. 3, folio 73), the Rose Hall Journal entry on May 23, 1830 (vol. 3, folio 74) stated that \u201cPitt & Kitty caught this Evening near Little River.\u201d It is unclear whether Kitty and Pitt (Creole) had coordinated their runaway attempts ahead of time or had joined together after they had absconded from Rose Hall. It is possible that visiting loved ones was one of the reasons for Kitty\u2019s runaway attempts.###In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, Kitty was noted as 20 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition. In the 1832 list, her duties were described as \u201cField,\u201d which meant she would have been one of many field workers, skilled agriculturalists and often herbalists, who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###We do not know the names of Kitty's parents; they could have been either African-born or Creole. The extant records do not include information about Kitty\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. We also do not know whether Kitty had children at Rose Hall, in other places in Jamaica, or in other parts of the African diaspora.

Glister\u2019s daughter was not the only newborn who died within the nine-day period and whose birth and passing were not recorded in the slave register.

We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Mary James was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances.

Memmy Sen\u2019s death was recorded in the 1826 Slave Register; her age recorded at the time of passing was 69 years old.

Memmy Sen may have been the mother of another African-born woman at Rose Hall named Miranda, who likely named her daughter Memmy Jun (short for Junior) after Memmy Sen (short for Senior).

Liddy (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child\u2014Parish\/Paris passed away at the age of 4.

We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Peggy was born but possibly John Rose Palmer who was in residence during that time period). Her father could also have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###Peggy\u2019s mother Mary James gave birth to at least 5 children\u20142 daughters Peggy (quadroon) and Eliza Hill (mulatto), and 3 sons John Kerr (quadroon), Henry (mulatto), and Edward Hill (mulatto).

Her first recorded attempt was mentioned in the Rose Hall Journal on September 1, 1818, when Rose would have been about 10 years old (vol. 1, folio 68).

It is unclear for how many years Rose had one leg, but if she had one leg for most or all of her life, the fact that she ran away at least 3 times demonstrated her desire to escape even with this physical limitation (and on one occasion departing through the roof of the hospital).###Entries in the Rose Hall Journal often included an overseer's comment that an enslaved person had absconded \u201cfor no cause\u201d or \u201cwithout cause.\u201d This reflects one of the central tenets of slavery that inaccurately presented slavery as a beneficent act bestowed on enslaved persons by enslavers. Instead, it is important to point out that enslaved persons recognized countless \u201ccauses\u201d for running away and other acts of resistance, whether they acted on this or not, given the range of violations and violences experienced in a state of bondage in Jamaica and throughout the African diaspora.###Rose\u2019s mother Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall\u2014Archy, Charles, Dianna, James, Robert, and Rose. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Rose, Dianna\/Diana, James, and Charles. Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Robert.

In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List she was listed as 39 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d and of \u201cgood\u201d disposition.###Her duties were described as \u201cField\u201d which meant she would have been one of many field workers, skilled agriculturalists and often herbalists, who were responsible for the laborious work of planting, tending, and harvesting sugarcane in the various sections of Rose Hall Plantation. Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###Susannah Johnston\/Elizabeth Palmer had at least 2 recorded runaway attempts. While pregnant, she ran away twice during the summer of 1830. Her first attempt was noted in the Rose Hall Journal on July 27, 1830: \u201cE. Palmer in an advanced State of Pregnancy absconded\u201d (vol. 3, folio 79). By the next month, a journal entry stated on August 16, 1830, that she ran away again while pregnant (vol. 3, folio 80). A couple of months after she returned to Rose Hall, she gave birth to a baby girl on December 5, 1830. Her baby passed away 3 days later on December 8, 1830. Although for many pregnant enslaved women, the risks of being pregnant and on the run seemed unimaginable; for others, their pregnancy may have served to encourage, rather than discourage, them from pursuing freedom for themselves and their unborn children.###When she ran away in 1830, Susannah Johnston\/Elizabeth Palmer had 4 children at Rose Hall Plantation between the ages of 2 and 16. Her other children at Rose Hall may have motivated her to return to Rose Hall in 1830. Susannah had at least 6 children at Rose Hall\u20144 daughters Helen, Phillis, Eve and Ellen (also referred to as Julian) and two sons July and Thomas. Susannah Johnston (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of multiple children\u2014Helen in 1820, Ellen\/Julian in 1826, and the daughter who passed at 3 days old.

Like many other sugarcane plantations in Jamaica (and throughout the Americas), the majority of field workers at Rose Hall Plantation were enslaved women, and the majority of enslaved women at this plantation were field workers. Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###We do not know the names of Zebra\u2019s parents; both most likely were African-born. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall\u2014Archy, Charles, Dianna, James, Robert, and Rose. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Rose, Dianna\/Diana, James, and Charles. Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Robert. In addition, her son Archey was transported off the island in 1826 as punishment for his multiple runaway attempts. We do not know how the passing of her child specifically affected Zebra.###The extant records do not include information about all of Zebra\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name(s) of the biological father(s) of Zebra\u2019s children. We also do not know whether she had additional children or grandchildren at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas, as well as children left behind in an African community (or communities). The details of her life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.",
