Zebra was a field worker at Rose Hall. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall (4 of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Rose, Dianna\/Diana, James, and Charles). Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child. Zebra\u2019s son Robert passed at the age of 7.

Charley\u2019s first recorded runaway attempt, at the age of 40, was noted in the journal on April 21, 1817 (vol. 1, folio 2).

Arabella was an African-born enslaved woman who, like Doshy, absconded from Rose Hall numerous times; Arabella ran away at least 13 times between 1817 and 1832. Indeed, in the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, Arabella was noted as a runaway and absent from Rose Hall at the time the list was being prepared.

Two weeks after he was imprisoned, a Rose Hall Journal entry mentioned that Mercury passed in the Montego Bay jail (vol. 1, folios 187 and 189). Charley also ran away with January on separate occasions.

Verdict died by the Visitation of God\u201d (vol. 2, folio 126). Although the inquest must have been arranged due to questions surrounding Charley\u2019s passing in the woods. It is unclear what particular issues were raised at the time. It is possible that self-imposed injuries or injuries caused by another person might have resulted in Charley\u2019s passing. In the end, his passing was deemed a divine act at the \u201cold\u201d age of 47.

Mary James\u2019s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Henry McLean\u2019s maternal grandmother, and Celia (Creole) was his maternal great grandmother. The extant records do not include information about all of Henry McLean\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora. ###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.",

Although he is not classified as a \u201cnotorious runaway,\u201d he absconded the most times from Rose Hall between 1817 and 1832. He was approximately 13 years old when his first runaway attempt was recorded on July 31, 1821. The overseer officially noted some form of punishment for his runaway attempts though it did not curtail Hercules\u2019 desires to run away. On May 27, 1830, a note in the Rose Hall Journal stated that \u201cHercules after receiving Chastisement for his late desertion escaped once more from his [illegible word] this night\u201d (vol. 3, folio 74). Later on October 24, 1830, the overseer relayed that \u201cHercules made his Escape from Confinement\u201d (vol. 3, folio 84), which is the only reference concerning him being punished via confinement at Rose Hall. Within a month of Hercules escaping confinement, on November 16, 1830, the overseer noted, \u201cHercules after being pardoned for his last offense again made his exit without cause.\u201d (vol. 3, folio 86) In only 2 of Hercules\u2019 runaway attempts did overseers note that Hercules had \u201creturned\u201d and not been \u201cbrought home.\u201d###Hercules is 1 of only 3 boys (between 1 and 17 years old) in the 1817 Slave Register not described as having a biological mother at Rose Hall.

Soon after Alick\u2019s passing, the Rose Hall Journal noted that Mary had a miscarriage, and she was in the area called the \u201chospital\u201d at Rose Hall during the first half of September 1832 recovering from this miscarriage (vol. 3, folios 132-134). We do not know how the passing of multiple children specifically affected Mary. Mary\u2019s mother (Jemmy\u2019s grandmother), Maphe (Creole) only had one child\u2014Mary.

We have no archival records indicating whether his biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Ned was born). His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family. As his primary position was at the \u201cOverseer's House,\u201d it is possible that this position reflected a connection to the overseer. Ned was 1 of 3 children described as at the overseer\u2019s house. The other 2 children were John Kerr and Richard Mabon, who were both Creole and classified as quadroon.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###Ned had one recorded runaway attempt.

It is unclear why Peter seemed to be responsible for Hercules at this time. However, on December 15, 1828, the very day that Peter was brought back to Rose Hall was the exact day that someone was sent to the Montego Bay Workhouse (vol. 3, folio 30). That person remained there through the holidays, and he was not released until January 3, 1829 (vol. 3, folio 35). This person was probably Peter.

His father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.",

Instead, her arduous work involved washing the clothes of the white enslavers of the Palmer family and any of their guests at Rose Hall. Her duties might also have been expanded on any given day due to the particular needs of the Palmer family and their guests. It is possible that Bessy had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Bessy\u2019s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Bessy was the daughter of Sarah (a Creole woman often referred to as Sambo Sarah). As Bessy was described as mulatto, her biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Bessy was born). Bessy\u2019s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by John Palmer. Between 1803 to 1808, Robert McLaren was one of the overseers who worked at Rose Hall and possibly for a short time at Palmyra in 1820-1821. Given his timing as overseer at Rose Hall, Bessy being born approximately in 1804, and Bessy\u2019s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Bessy\u2019s father.###Bessy had 2 sons\u2014Richard aka Richard Mabon (9 years old in 1832) and Robert (3 years old in 1832). Both Richard and Robert were described in the slave registers as \u201cquadroons.\u201d Bessy\u2019s son Robert\u2019s \u201cChristian name\u201d was listed as \u201cLawrence Low.\u201d Lawrence Lowe was one of the overseers at Rose Hall Plantation between 1826 and 1832. Bessy\u2019s son Richard was listed as \u201cat the Overseer\u2019s House\u201d in 1832, and Lawrence Lowe was overseer at that time. Moreover, as Robert was identified as a quadroon and with his particular \u201cChristian name,\u201d it is certainly feasible that his biological father was overseer Lawrence Lowe. Richard\u2019s position at the overseer\u2019s house did not necessarily indicate the breadth of the interactions between Bessy and the overseer Lawrence Lowe.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###We do not know whether both of Bessy\u2019s children had the same white biological father; we also do not know whether Bessy had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.

It is possible that Brown had labored at Rose Hall for many years before 1817; the details of Brown\u2019s life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.###Brown had at least one child at Rose Hall\u2014a daughter named Charity. As with countless other infants born in bondage in Jamaica and in other parts of the Americas, Brown\u2019s daughter Charity lived for only a short period of time. Her birth and passing (at the age of 3 months) was listed in the 1829 Slave Register. We do not know how the passing of Charity specifically affected Brown. We do not know whether Brown had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.###Brown\u2019s mother was African-born Augusta.

Perhaps being in her 60s afforded her that limited benefit.

We do not know whether she considered this duty a blessing, a burden, or both. As the eldest African-born woman at Rose Hall, Cecelia may have understood her job attending to young children as an avenue for sharing information about African history, stories, lessons, and cultural practices with these young children (and others at Rose Hall). Even as she attended to the young children, Cecelia also may have attended to the other enslaved mothers at Rose Hall, aiding and guiding them in the care of their young children in ways that integrated West African or West Central African cultural customs with which she was familiar.###We do not know the names of Cecelia\u2019s parents; both were most likely African-born. Cecelia had at least 3 children who resided at Rose Hall\u2014one daughter Liddy and 2 sons Smith and Harry. Cecelia was also the grandmother of at least 3 grandchildren\u2014Liddy\u2019s daughter Pastora and 2 sons North and Parish\/Paris.

The other person named Eliza at Rose Hall was Creole, negro (in colour), and daughter of Dorinda. Eliza Hill was described in the 1829 Register as Creole, mulatto (in colour), 18 months old, and daughter of Mary James (Creole). In the 1832 Rose Hall Clothing Allowance List, she was listed as 4 years old, \u201chealthy,\u201d of \u201cgood\u201d disposition, and \u201cnot at work\u201d (due to her age).###Eliza Hill\u2019s mother, Mary James, had at least 5 children at Rose Hall\u2014John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill and Peggy. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832 \u2014John Kerr, Henry McLean, Eliza Hill, Edward Hill. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Peggy. It is also possible that Mary James had other children who resided at plantations other than Rose Hall. Mary James\u2019s mother, Rosannah (Creole), was Eliza Hill\u2019s maternal grandmother. Rosannah passed away before Eliza was born. Celia (Creole) was Eliza Hill\u2019s maternal great grandmother, and she had a long-recorded lineage at Rose Hall.###As both Mary James and Eliza Hill were described as mulatto, Eliza Hill\u2019s biological father was probably a white man (in which case Eliza Hill should have been categorized as a \u201cquadroon\u201d at that time). Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of Eliza Hill\u2019s biological father. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Eliza Hill was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family at that time.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###The extant records do not include information about all of Eliza Hill\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any in Jamaica, the Caribbean, or another part of the African diaspora.

The other enslaved person listed with this duty was Charles (Creole), who was 13 years old in 1832. The range of responsibilities involved in being with Mrs. Palmer is unclear. That Mrs. Palmer had 2 enslaved persons attending to her (1 male and the other female and both in their teens) may have reflected the breadth and range of duties that included domestic, personal care, as well as more involved arduous work that required the abilities of 2 enslaved people on a quotidian basis.###Jane Cranston had given birth to at least 1 child at Rose Hall\u2014a daughter Lydie. Jane (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child, as Lydie passed at 7 days old. Lydie\u2019s birth and passing were recorded in the 1826 Slave Register, which meant that Jane had given birth when she was between 9 and 12 years old. Jane\u2019s young age at the time of her daughter\u2019s birth and the unstated circumstances related to conception possibly contributed to the death of her newborn. Jane Cranston was the daughter of Sarah (a Creole woman often referred to as Sambo Sarah).###As Jane Cranston was described as mulatto, her biological father was a white man. We have no archival records indicating whether her white biological father was a member of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before Jane Cranston was born). Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children.

Her father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned the Palmer family.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances. Some families may have experienced multiple generations of interracial rape at Rose Hall.###Mary James had at least 5 children at Rose Hall\u20142 daughters Peggy (quadroon) and Eliza Hill (mulatto), and 3 sons John Kerr (quadroon), Henry McLean (mulatto) and Edward Hill (mulatto). Peggy and John were categorized as quadroon, but we also do not know which white man (or white men) sired these two children, and again here we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d\u2014whether or not one or more white men sired her children. Mary James (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Peggy passed at 2 years old. We do not know how the passing of Peggy specifically affected Mary James.###Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name of the biological father(s) of Mary James\u2019 children. We also do not know whether she had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.

Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###Pastora\u2019s mother Liddy had at least 3 children at Rose Hall\u2014Pastora and 2 sons North and Parish\/Paris. Liddy (like many other enslaved mothers) also experienced the passing of a child\u2014Parish\/Paris passed away at the age of 4.

As 3 of her children (Bessy, Jane Cranston and William) were described as mulatto, their biological father(s) was a white man (or white men). We have no archival records indicating whether their white biological father(s) were members of the white Palmer family (though not the elder John Palmer as he died in 1797 before they were born).###Bessy\u2019s father may have been one of the white bookkeepers or overseers at Rose Hall or the neighboring plantation of Palmyra that was also owned by John Palmer. Between 1803 to 1808, Robert McLaren was one of the overseers who worked at Rose Hall and possibly for a short time at Palmyra in 1820-1821. Given his timing as overseer at Rose Hall, Bessy being born approximately in 1804, and Bessy\u2019s surname on the 1832 Clothing Allowance List, it is likely that he was Bessy\u2019s father.###We do not know whether both of Bessy\u2019s children (Richard and Robert), described as quadroon, had the same white biological father. We also do not know whether Bessy had children at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas.###Some scholars have downplayed the characterization of acts of sexual violation during slavery, especially in the discussion of enslaved mothers of mulatto or quadroon children. It is critical to recognize that whether sexual violation occurred one time or transpired over decades between a white enslaver or overseer and an enslaved woman, the simultaneity of power, domination, and violence exercised through sexual acts must be directly recognized and addressed. Given the racial, gendered, and class power dynamics of the slavocracy in Jamaica, we cannot assume \u201cconsent\u201d of enslaved women in these circumstances.

Due to the significant number of enslaved men who tended to the larger livestock, were engaged in duties related to the agri-industrial processing of the byproducts of sugarcane, and labored as artisans\/craftspeople, only a small minority of enslaved men at Rose Hall Plantation worked as field workers.###We do not know the names of Zebra\u2019s parents; both most likely were African-born. Zebra had at least 6 children at Rose Hall\u2014Archy, Charles, Dianna, James, Robert, and Rose. Four of her children survived from birth to 1832\u2014Rose, Dianna\/Diana, James, and Charles. Zebra (like many other enslaved mothers) experienced the passing of a child\u2014Robert. In addition, her son Archey was transported off the island in 1826 as punishment for his multiple runaway attempts. We do not know how the passing of her child specifically affected Zebra.###The extant records do not include information about all of Zebra\u2019s familial and other relationships at Rose Hall or at any other places in Jamaica or throughout the African diaspora. Due to the colonial record-keeping process of only including the names of enslaved mothers of enslaved children, we do not know the name(s) of the biological father(s) of Zebra\u2019s children. We also do not know whether she had additional children or grandchildren at other plantations in Jamaica or in other parts of the Americas, as well as children left behind in an African community (or communities). The details of her life before 1817 and after 1832 have not been uncovered at this time.",
