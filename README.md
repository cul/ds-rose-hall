# (Un)Silencing Slavery

## The project

This ember app produces the website
for [(Un)Silencing Slavery: Remembering the Enslaved at Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica](https://unsilencing-slavery.org/). The project re-centers the lives of enslaved persons at Rose Hall Plantation by emphasizing the history of slavery and enslaved persons at that historical site. It is a companion piece to Jamaican-born and U.S.-based scholar Celia E. Naylor’s 2022 book entitled (Un)Silencing Slavery: Telling Truths about Rose Hall Plantation, Jamaica. We have launched this website as part of Jamaica’s 60th Diamond Celebration of Independence (August 6, 1962–August 6, 2022) and the annual celebration of Emancipendence. In this spirit, the website also honors the countless freedom fighters over many centuries and generations in Jamaica.

## The App

This website is built using the [Ember](https://emberjs.com/) JavaScript framework, with some additional external libraries (such as D3) that enrich the user experience. The full code is available on GitHub, and the website relies on a dataset to be deposited presently in Columbia University’s academic repository, Academic Commons. The site was rebuilt nearly from scratch starting in late 2020, a process documented in the Rose Hall Project livestream on Twitch, and [collected on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn2mSnvztA5s7X84qAyMx910x5s4-hluY).

The graphic design was developed in-house by the below cited scholars, but we have relied on the font [Junction](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/junction), designed by Caroline Hadilaksono and Tyler Finck, for the body text and [Lusitana](https://cargocollective.com/anamegda/LUSITANA), designed by Ana Megda, for the display text.
